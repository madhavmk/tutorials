    "The RAG based approach below is a demonstration of how to use [OLMo-1B](https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-1B) LLM model by AI2 to generate an abstract completion for a given input text. The input text is a random starting abstract from `astro-ph` category of [ArXiv Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). The abstract completion is generated by the model using the RAG approach. The RAG approach retrieves relevant documents from [Qdrant Vector Database](https://qdrant.tech/), which provides contextual information to the model for generating the completion.\n",
