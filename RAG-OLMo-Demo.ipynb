We then discuss\\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry.

These objects\\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\\ndebris disks.

      "page_content='  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\\naccretion curtain model.\\n' metadata={'id': '0704.0017', 'title': 'Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in\\n  Quiescence', 'categories': 'astro-ph'}\n",
      "page_content='  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\\n' metadata={'id': '0704.0023', 'title': 'ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere', 'categories': 'astro-ph'}\n",
      "page_content='  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\\napplications are discussed in detail.\\n' metadata={'id': '0704.0044', 'title': 'Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in\\n  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas', 'categories': 'astro-ph nlin.CD physics.plasm-ph physics.space-ph'}\n",
